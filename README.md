# S-Expression-Converter
CLI program that convert expression to s-expression

This is my first rust program. The main purpose is to assist students who need to write Racket code. It will also be the prerequisite of  [Felys-Interpreter](https://github.com/FelysNeko/Felys-Interpreter) future version, because it covers concepts such as tokenizer and parser.
